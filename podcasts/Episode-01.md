# Episode 1 — Thresholds & Transformations

Theme
-----
Why rites of passage matter universally: psychological foundations of liminality, identity transition, and "earned confidence." Target length: 20–30 minutes.

Research runs (summary)
------------------------
1. Psychology of liminality & adolescence — key authors: Erikson (identity stages), Victor Turner (liminality), Arnold van Gennep (rites of passage), Jung (archetypes).
2. Cross-cultural models — separation → liminal ordeal → reintegration; functional outcomes for identity and social role.

Episode structure (suggested)
-----------------------------
- Intro (2–3m): hook + problem statement — modern lack of clear thresholds.
- Story segment (6–8m): a cross-cultural or historical example (e.g., Spartan Agoge vignette or a Maasai initiation scene).
- Expert synthesis (8–10m): concise explanation of liminality, psychological mechanics, and why rites served communities.
- Practical takeaways (3–5m): what modern mentors/families can learn; teaser for Episode 2.

Production notes
----------------
- Use a single illustrative story to anchor abstract concepts.
- Layer narration with short archival quotes (Van Gennep, Turner) and plain-language explanations.
- Suggested sound design: restrained ambient field recording under the story segment; music swells on transitions.

Outputs
-------
- Final script / episode audio (20–30m)
- Episode transcript
- Links to research brief and symbol glossary (host on `website/`)

1. Pull citations and short quotes into the research brief.
2. Draft a full episode script from this outline.
3. Record a short test narration to confirm tone and pacing.
