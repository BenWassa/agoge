# Project Agoge

> **Forging boys into grounded, resilient men through the timeless power of initiation.**

Project Agoge is a solo, AI-assisted research & storytelling endeavor that mines history, myth, psychology, and anthropology to understand how traditional rites of passage shaped confident, morally strong men—and how we can adapt that wisdom today.  
The repository is the single source of truth for every artifact: deep-research briefs, podcast scripts, the static website, and all supporting assets.
