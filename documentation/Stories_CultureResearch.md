# Rite-Stories Research Deck — Cultural Backgrounds & Checklists

*A working brief to keep each short story vivid **and** responsible to the culture/timeframe it evokes.*

---

## 1) Old Norse (útiseta / seiðr) — ca. 950–1050 CE, Norway–Iceland

**Where / When**  
Late Viking Age coastal Norway and Iceland; long winter nights; turf longhouses; law-things; conversion era tensions (pagan/Christian overlap).

**Rite / Kernel Image**  
*Útiseta* (“sitting-out”): overnight vigil at a liminal place (grave mound, crossroads, cliff), sometimes tied to *seiðr* practice for wisdom, counsel, or contact with the dead. Often solitary; cold, hunger, and fear as teachers.

**Cosmos / Belief**  
World of gods, land-wights, and the honored dead; fate/“wyrd” intertwined with oaths. Odin as seeker of runes and breath (speech). Practical ethics echoed in *Hávamál* (caution, hospitality, self-mastery).

**Social texture**  
Farmsteads; ships and seasonal raiding/trading; law assemblies; honor economy; strong kin obligations; outlawry as existential peril.

**Material culture**  
Wool cloaks, vadmal, fur-lined boots; iron knives/axes; seal oil lamps; rune-carved staffs; burial mounds with grave goods. Sounds: wind over scree, eider on fjords, creak of ship-timbers, alliterative chant.

**Language & style cues**  
- Names: Aud, Thorkel, Gudrun, Hallgerd, Leif, Yrsa.  
- Diction: taut, alliterative prose; kennings ("whale-road" for sea, "battle-sweat" for blood).  
- Short stave of gnomic verse to punctuate scenes (original or pastiche), e.g.,  
  *“Cold keeps counsel / on the cairn’s crown;*  
  *Hold fast your heart / lest fear find tongue.”*  
- Rune motifs: *Ansuz* (breath/word), *Raidho* (journey), *Kenaz* (torch/vision) — used sparingly as scene glyphs.

**Accuracy checklist**  
- Note that *útiseta* is attested in medieval Icelandic sources and linked to magic/forbidden practices in law codes; avoid anachronistic neo-shaman glosses.  
- Cross-check runic alphabet (Younger vs. Elder Futhark) for date/place.  
- Balance Odin-wise seeking with everyday farm/law obligations; avoid “Viking = only raider.”

**To look up (citables / scene seeds)**  
- Specific *Hávamál* stanzas suitable for epigraphs; Codex Regius notes.  
- Mentions of *útiseta* in Icelandic law (prohibitions), and any saga episode of mound-sitting.

### Cross-project Notes

- **Permissions & Protocols**: For Aboriginal Australian and Lakota content, confirm what is public vs. restricted; avoid sacred lyrics/imagery without consent.  
- **Songs & Runes**: Use original texts sparingly and within public domain; otherwise create pastiche that matches meter and feel without quoting beyond brief, credited lines.  
- **Names & Diacritics**: Maintain correct marks (Lakȟóta, Hanbléčheyapi; Yindjibarndi/Yinjibarndi variants); provide ASCII fallback when needed.  
- **Sensory Palette**: Each story should foreground its land—fjords, Eurotas reeds, savanna dust, spinifex heat, Black Hills wind, rainforest humidity, Kyoto incense, Persepolis stone.
