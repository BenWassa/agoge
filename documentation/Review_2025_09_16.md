# Review of Project Agoge
*Date: September 16, 2025*

## index.html
- [x] make episodes 3 and 4
- [ ] add links to research docs as pdf
- [ ] find/make images?

### Van Gennep model
- [ ] make 3 images for stages

### Symbols
- [ ] spacing needs to be more compact

### The Library
- [ ] link to library html page with individual html pages for each episode? (uncertain as this would break single page flow)

### About
- [ ] cut Notion/Email buttons
- [ ] consider logo/symbol for Agoge
- [ ] update about from OG notes to add

### Navigation (to add)
- [ ] use sections after "the Journey Unfolds"
- [ ] clickable links on the side maybe - something minimalist
