# **Website Plan — Project Agoge**

## 1. **Overall Vision**

A portfolio site that feels like a **journey and an artifact**: professional, credible, and sleek enough for young professionals, but mythic and evocative in its imagery and storytelling. Visitors should immediately feel they’ve stepped into a **threshold space** — a site that *itself* embodies the idea of initiation.

## 2. **Hero Section (Landing Index)**

The centerpiece of the site. Minimal, polished, and visually striking.

* **Rotating Archetypal Faces:** Slow crossfade between close-up portraits (Maasai, Spartan, Viking, Samurai, Yanomami, Persian). Each face neutral, solemn, filling the frame.
* **Overlay:**

  * Title: *Project Agoge* (large serif, muted gold).
  * Tagline: *“Forging boys into grounded, resilient men.”*
  * CTA: *“Enter the Journey”* — scrolls to manifesto.
* **Mood:** Sacred, cinematic, modern. The site begins not with explanation, but with presence.

---

## 3. **Narrative Flow & Pages**

### **Home**

* **Manifesto Block:** Four concise paragraphs introducing the problem (loss of rites), the vision (Agoge as recovery), and the journey (episodes + research).
* **Pull-Quote Highlight:** *“In the Agoge, we discover not just strength of body, but strength of character.”*
* **Episode Journey Teaser:** Horizontal timeline graphic → clickable nodes for Episodes 1–4.

### **Episodes**

* Vertical scroll, each episode as a “chapter card.”
* Card design: title, subtitle, one-sentence hook, embedded podcast, link to research brief, optional symbolic artwork.
* Interactivity: expandable notes or “key takeaways” for each episode.
* Flow feels like reading chapters in a book.

### **Insights**

* **Core Pillars Grid:** Confidence–Competence, Resilience, Moral Strength, Community Self-Worth (each with icon + 2 sentences).
* **Van Gennep’s Model:** Timeline diagram (Separation → Liminality → Reintegration).
* **Symbols & Archetypes Glossary:** Icons with hover text (Fire, Death/Rebirth, Ordeal, Mentor, Recognition).

### **Library**

* A clean research repository: each brief listed with abstract + download link.
* Grouped by episode for intuitive navigation.
* Tone: scholarly but still approachable.

### **About**

* First-person note on why you built Project Agoge.
* Professional but personal.
* Contact links: GitHub, Notion, Email.
* Optional symbolic logo (shield, fire, ouroboros).

## 4. **Look & Feel**

* **Hero Section:** Bold, cinematic, faces on dark backgrounds. Minimal text overlay.
* **Color Palette:** Dark charcoal base, muted gold accents, earth greens, bone white text.
* **Typography:** Serif for titles/headings (*Playfair Display*), clean sans-serif (*Inter* or *Poppins*) for content.
* **Layout:** Spacious, grid-based, high readability. Use whitespace to balance the heaviness of the imagery.
* **Motion:** Subtle fades, slow parallax, hover highlights. No clutter, no fast animations.

---

## 5. **Interactivity & Engagement**

* Timeline navigation is clickable (Episodes + Insights).
* Glossary and diagrams reveal more detail on hover.
* Faces rotate slowly at landing, setting tone.
* Expansion notes for Episodes keep the flow compact but deep when opened.

---

## 6. **Future Scalability**

* Each episode release adds a new “chapter card” to Episodes + Library.
* More cultural faces can be added to the landing rotation over time.
* Toolkit resources (parents, educators) could eventually live in Insights or a new **Practice** page.
