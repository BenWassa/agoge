# **Website Plan**

## 1. **Overall Vision**

A modern, professional portfolio site that leads with your **manifesto** and draws visitors into a **narrative journey**: from mythic past → cross-cultural rites → symbolic insights → today’s challenges → your podcast episodes as the chronological path forward.
It must feel **credible and sleek** (to impress professionals), while also **evocative and mythic** (to capture the spiritual weight of rites).

---

## 2. **Site Structure & Navigation**

**Navigation Bar (fixed top, minimalist):**

* **Home** (Vision / Manifesto)
* **Episodes** (Chronological journey through podcast + docs)
* **Insights** (Key pillars, models, diagrams, symbolism glossary)
* **Library** (Research briefs & references)
* **About** (Author statement, contact info)

---

## 3. **Page-by-Page Content Plan**

### **Home (Landing Page)**

* **Hero Section:**

  * Dark background (deep green/black gradient with gold accents).
  * Title: *Project Agoge* (strong serif font, gold).
  * Subtitle tagline: *“Forging boys into grounded, resilient men through the timeless power of initiation.”*
  * Call-to-action: “Enter the Journey” (scrolls to manifesto).

* **Manifesto Block:**

  * White/neutral text on dark background, max 4–5 short paragraphs.
  * Purpose: Reclaiming rites of passage for today.
  * Pull-quote in gold serif font (e.g., “In the Agoge, we discover not just strength of body, but strength of character”).

* **Episode Journey Teaser:**

  * Horizontal timeline graphic with milestones: *Thresholds* → *Wisdom of the Elders* → *Sacred Symbols* → *Virtue Forged in Fire*.
  * Each clickable → links to full Episodes page.

---

### **Episodes Page** *(chronological path)*

* Layout: Vertical scrolling journey, each episode a “chapter card.”
* Each card includes:

  * Episode title + short subtitle.
  * Embedded podcast player (Spotify/Anchor).
  * One-sentence hook (why this rite matters).
  * Link to supporting research brief (PDF/Markdown).
  * Space for symbolic artwork / cultural imagery (placeholder if not yet sourced).
* Interactivity placeholder: Expand/collapse episode notes or “Key Takeaways” popups.

---

### **Insights Page** *(Key Models & Takeaways)*

* **Section 1: Core Pillars**

  * Four illustrated blocks: Confidence–Competence, Resilience, Moral Strength, Community Self-Worth.

* **Section 2: Van Gennep’s Model**

  * Interactive diagram placeholder: *Separation → Liminality → Reintegration*.

* **Section 3: Symbols & Archetypes**

  * Glossary grid: Fire, Death/Rebirth, Ordeal, Mentor, Recognition.
  * Small icons + short 1–2 sentence explanations.

---

### **Library Page** *(Research Repository)*

* Simple list/grid of research briefs:

  * Title + short abstract + download link.
  * Grouped by episode for easy navigation.

---

### **About Page**

* Author statement (short, direct, first person).
* Why you built Project Agoge.
* Contact links: GitHub, Notion, Email.
* Optional headshot or symbolic logo (could be an AI gen placeholder like a Spartan shield or fire symbol).

---

## 4. **Look & Feel**

* **Color Palette:**

  * Base: Dark charcoal/black.
  * Accents: Muted gold (#C9A43B), earth green (#395E3C), bone white (#F4F1EC).
  * Hover states / CTA highlights in brighter gold.

* **Typography:**

  * Titles / Headings: Strong serif (e.g., *Merriweather*, *Playfair Display*).
  * Body / Content: Clean sans-serif (e.g., *Inter*, *Poppins*, *Roboto*).

* **Layout Style:**

  * Grid-based, spacious, professional.
  * Subtle parallax or fade-in animations for episode cards and insights.
  * High readability (plenty of whitespace).

---

## 5. **Interactivity Placeholders**

* Episode cards expand/collapse for notes.
* Insights diagrams interactive (hover reveals explanations).
* Timeline navigation clickable.
* “Glossary” terms reveal definitions on hover.

*(First version: static scaffolds, later swapped for simple JS animations.)*

---

## 6. **Technical Approach**

* **Static HTML/CSS** for baseline (Claude builds clean).
* **Responsive design** (must look good on mobile, since Gen Z target).
* **Embed Spotify/Anchor players** for episodes.
* **Host on GitHub Pages** for free, portfolio-ready deployment.
* Keep all supporting docs downloadable via GitHub repo links.
