# Thresholds & Transformations

Summary
-------
This brief collects the core psychological and anthropological sources that explain why rites of passage appear in diverse cultures and how they function to produce identity transitions, social legitimacy, and what we call "earned confidence." It will feed the Episode 1 script and provide source material for quotes and show notes.

Research runs
-------------
1. Psychology of liminality & adolescence
	- Key concepts: identity formation, role transition, liminal ambiguity, rite-as-social-solution.
	- Core authors: Erikson (psychosocial stages), Jung (archetypal motifs), modern developmental psychologists.

2. Ritual theory & cross-cultural models
	- Key concepts: van Gennep's three stages (separation, liminality, reintegration); Victor Turner's liminality and communitas.
	- Cross-cultural examples: Maasai, Spartan Agoge, Satere‑Mawé (bullet ant initiations), Aboriginal Australian songlines and initiation rites.

Suggested primary sources & citations
------------------------------------
- van Gennep, A. (1960). The Rites of Passage.
- Turner, V. (1969). The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure.
- Erikson, E. (1950). Childhood and Society.
- Campbell, J. (1949). The Hero with a Thousand Faces. (for archetypal framing)

Illustrative case study (short)
------------------------------
Pick one vivid, ethically-sourced vignette to narrate in the episode (e.g., a Spartan youth's training scene or a Maasai initiation camp). For each candidate, collect 2–3 short, attributable quotes or descriptions and note the source.

Analytical framing
------------------
- Why rites solved coordination problems: clarified role expectations and publicly signaled competence.
- Psychological mechanism: ritualized stress and symbolic rebirth can accelerate identity consolidation.
- Social outcomes: reinforcement of group norms, clearer adult responsibilities, and social recognition.

Planned outputs
---------------
- Episode research brief (this document)
- Full episode script and transcript
- Links and short reading list for show notes and website

Next steps
----------
1. Add 6–8 short, citable extracts (2–3 sentences each) from the primary sources above.
2. Choose and expand the illustrative case study with source citations.
3. Draft the first full script using the episode outline in `podcasts/Episode-01.md`.

Notes on ethics & sourcing
-------------------------
When using ethnographic examples, prefer primary ethnographies and respectful translations. Avoid sensationalizing painful practices — aim for context and nuance.
